# Golang learning log - Week 4
## Skills to learn:
- Git and Github fluency and learning the commands and navigation
- Planning and realizing project ideas
- Focusing on one thing at a time and doing it good enough (i have a tendency to jump around topics and not stick to one thing)
## Current plans:
- im gonna refine the calculator and finish it. 
- [] adding a way to track every past calculations(history with a slice) 
- [] moving the calculations into its own package( not a feature )
- [] continuous calculation
- [] word counter using map[string] int
- [] a system to automaticly exit if the input is repeated and the program does not execute as designed.
## Progress: 
progress and toughts:
currently im implementing the continous calculations ive been thinking of if operators in order for the calculations to never fuck up and be consistent. the code is pretty self explanatory but i believe i implemented alot of unecessary complex design patterns. if i could simplify it i would, but i lack knowledge.
## Random blabber
- been fun thinking about designs and how to potentially implement specific features at work. programming is truly an art of it's own. sinking my time inside of it has been as good as it gets whether games, work, reading mangas, entertainment. that kind of stuff feels good but it ain't productive and it doesnt really challenge you in such a capacity as coding and problem solving does.
