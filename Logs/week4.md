# Golang learning log - Week 4

## Skills i gotta learn

- git and github fluency and basics
- stopping boot.dev for a little and make my own projects simple ones really just to practice the concepts and ingrian them into my head.
- ide mastery, im using vscode and i must say it's extremely good and refined but i'd prefer something less bloated and less shinier there's so many stuff i do not use inside of it ctrl t, ctrl n, ctrl w, ctrl+shift+s all i know about lol.

## notes from boot.dev:

Blocks are defined by curly braces {}. New blocks are created for:

    Functions
    Loops
    If statements
    Switch statements
    Select statements
    Explicit blocks
    i sometimes forget them for else statements

## Stuff i learned this week:

- Operators with if statements: _Gotta keep those in mind_
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

---

- defer statements: they stop and execute till the end of the surrounding functions.
- early returns, amazing for error handling and avoiding nested if statements. stops before the snowball effect happens.

## future reviews:

- importing and reviewing specific packages and what they offer, i know about math,time,fmt but i just scratched the surface of their capablities.
- functions and how to name and use them properly i get sometimes confused with the syntax like func hello(func()hiiii()func()) and let's pretend there's stuff inside them
