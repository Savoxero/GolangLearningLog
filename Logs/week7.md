# Golang learning log - Week 7
## Skills to learn:
- Git and Github fluency and learning the commands and navigation
- Planning and realizing project ideas
- Focusing on one thing at a time and doing it good enough (i have a tendency to jump around topics and not stick to one thing)
## Current plans:
### Calculator project:
- [] word counter using map[string] int
- [] a system to automatically exit if the input is repeated and the program does not execute as designed.
- removing nested loops and finding a way to replace them with functions or another clever way
### general learning:
- [] reading a shitton of documentation on git and programming generally
- noting each Cause -> EFFECT -> Fix 
## Habits ( gpt notes)
- Design before keysmashing. Write the program flow as pseudocode before touching Go. Your problem isn’t logic—it’s pre-planning.
