# Golang learning log - Week 8
## Skills to learn:
- Git and Github fluency and learning the commands and navigation
- Planning and realizing project ideas
- Focusing on one thing at a time and doing it good enough (i have a tendency to jump around topics and not stick to one thing)
- cause -> effect -> fix logging for problems encountered
## Current plans: 
- Todolist CLI
- resuming boot.dev
- using git and github with more consistency
## Habits ( gpt notes)
- Design before keysmashing. Write the program flow as pseudocode before touching Go.
- pre planning
## Using my strenghts (GPT notes)
- Channel your pattern intuition into writing design notes before code. When you see repetition, stop, sketch the logic, then rewrite.
- Exploit your self-awareness: build a routine that deliberately isolates one task 
## Progress log
- I understood github a little better, i am able to isolate a part of my project and upload it to github without necessary garbage around it, essentially isolating what matters.
