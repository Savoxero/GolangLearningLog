# Week 1 Learning Log

## I have learned about the following topics:

- How to create a directory in Go
- How to create a file in Go
- How to create a package in Go

## Insights:

Everything inside Go is fragile and i have to lead the directory structure carefully and with precision, kind of like leading the computer by handholding it along the way.

## Toughts:

Learned about directories, Files and Packages in Go very very confusing at first but i feel relieved now. now that everything has some logical sense its easier to grasp the concepts.

## To do:

Back to learning inside W3Schools and then come back to this repository to learn more about Go.
