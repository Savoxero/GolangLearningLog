## Introduction
Sup, my name is Wiktor I'm 20 years old, I'm from Poland. I work as a waiter currently, learning golang aspiring to become a backend dev one day. I enjoy coding in my spare time, sometimes the job doesn't really allow me to spend the much needed time
but i always try to code, learn new stuff, improve. i enjoy the gym, games, system design, reverse engineering alot of things in life (not only coding) and i love having a deep understanding of something.
- This log is dedicated to show my progress on golang and generally my journey as a developer. I log weekly, i commit whenever i have the time to do so and when i've piled up some stuff i've learned or achieved.
 - I use ai/LLMS to help me learn. but i do not let it replace my thinking nor do i copy paste code and call it "learning", i deeply try to understand structures, if i don't understand something i persist with it till i understand it, till it **CLICKS**.
   Boot.dev gave me some foundamental knowledge about golang and thanks to it, Claude(in some way), and external resources I created my calculator. from top to bottom. AI is really helpful in letting u digest the concepts. You can get inspired fast to just go and
   test the new concept you've learned about and perhaps even implement it and get even more experience and deepen your understanding.
- I am at beginner/Newbie level in programming/Backend and there's still alot to work on. u can easily get stuck and absorbed in "perfecting" your projects or passively reading or consuming documents or tutorials.
## Current Focus
Right now, my main focus is **building strong fundamentals in Go (Golang)**.  
I’m actively learning about:
- Core syntax and semantics of the Go language
- Slices, maps, pointers, and memory behavior
- Structs, interfaces, and type systems
- Writing clean, modular, and idiomatic Go code
- Building CLI tools and simple backend projects
- Reading trough documentation and implementing whatever i feel would work

My short-term goal is to fully understand Go’s standard library and its approach to concurrency and error handling before moving toward full backend systems.

## Learning Approach
I follow a **theory + practice** approach:
1. **Understand deeply** — I don’t skip concepts until they *click*.  
2. **Apply immediately** — every new idea gets tested in small experiments or mini-projects.  
3. **Reflect weekly** — I document what worked, what failed, and what I’ve learned.

I prefer **building from scratch** over using frameworks I don’t understand. This helps me truly grasp what’s going on under the hood.

## Tools & Resources
I primarily use:
- **Boot.dev** — foundational lessons for Go and backend principles  
- **AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude)** — to clarify concepts, brainstorm, and receive feedback  
- **VS Code + Go extensions** — for development and debugging  
- **GitHub** — for version control and documenting my journey  

I also rely on small projects and experiments to test how specific Go features behave in real-world situations.

## Completed / Ongoing Projects
- > **CLI Calculator (Go)** — My first full project written completely from scratch.  
  - Handles input parsing, math operations, and dynamic history using slices.  
  - Helped me learn stdin handling, packages, and program design.  

- > **Learning Experiments** — Ongoing small Go snippets exploring:
  - Slice growth and capacity management  
  - Map mutation behavior in functions  
  - Pointer semantics and memory allocation

## Goals
**Short-term (1–3 months):**
- Strengthen understanding of Go data structures and concurrency  
- Build a few more CLI-based tools to reinforce fundamentals  
- Learn basic REST API development and JSON handling  

**Mid-term (3–6 months):**
- Transition to small backend projects using Go  
- Learn testing, dependency injection, and clean architecture patterns  
- Contribute to an open-source Go project  

**Long-term:**
- Achieve financial independence as a backend developer  
- Build systems that are efficient, minimal, and maintainable  
- Develop a deep understanding of distributed systems and design principles  

---

## Notes to Self
- Don’t rush. Every deep understanding compounds over time.  
- Keep building, even when motivation dips. Momentum matters more than speed.  
- Reflect weekly and iterate on what could be improved — both in code and mindset.  
- Never let AI replace thinking. Let it accelerate *learning*, not *execution*.

## Closing Thoughts
This repository is not just about Go — it’s about **discipline, consistency, and mastery**.  
I want to document not only the code I write but also the **mental progress** I make as I move from beginner to backend engineer.
